  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
  
  <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.state} and I work as a {identity.job}.</li>
    <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
